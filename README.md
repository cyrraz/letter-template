letter-template
===============

Very simple template for a letter in LaTeX.

In the following, it is assumed that you already have a distribution for the TeX typesetting system, such as [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). An alternative is to use an online LaTeX editor, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

To produce the letter in pdf format, run `make`.
